you look like a fucking snail
you look like your mom, a fucking whale
You are so ugly that when your mom dropped you off at school, she got a ticket for littering.
If stupidity was painful, you'd be in agony.
If I throw a stick, will you go away?
you look like a sunk worse hygiene
when you were born, you mom gave you to the dad with a stamp on your head on a note on you hand saying "Return to sender". your real dad was the mail man
Anybody who told you to just be yourself couldn't have given you worse advice.
If you were a color, you would be grey.
Your dad doesnt need sun glasses, beacuse you dont shine so bright.
